    <string name="poem1">One, two, three, four, five,\n
Once I caught a fish alive,\n
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,\n
Then I let go again.\n\n

Why did you let it go?\n
Because it bit my finger so.\n
Which finger did it bite?\n
This little finger on the right</string>

    <string name="poem3">Baa, baa black sheep\n
Have you any wool\n
Yes sir, yes sir\n
Three bags full.\n\n

One for my master\n
And one for my dame\n
And one for the little boy\n
Who lives down the lane.</string>
    <string name="poem4">Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,\n

Couldn’t put Humpty together again.</string>
    <string name="poem5">Jack and Jill went up the hill\n
To fetch a pail of water.\n
Jack fell down and broke his crown,\n
And Jill came tumbling after.\n\n

Up Jack got and home did trot\n
As fast as he could caper;\n
And went to bed to mend his head\n
With vinegar and brown paper.</string>
    <string name="poem6">Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n
How I wonder what you are!\n
Up above the world so high,\n
Like a diamond in the sky.\n\n

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n
How I wonder what you are!\n\n

When the blazing sun is gone,\n
When he nothing shines upon,\n
When you shower your little light,\n
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.\n\n

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n
How I wonder what you are!</string>
